> A Wordpress Plugin to easily create Grid Layouts from the compose-screen.

Easily create Grid Layouts from within the compose screen, for Posts, Pages and Custom Post Types. 

We build this plugin to give wordpress authors a GUI to create Grid Systems without HTML-Knowledge.

Just define a row, insert multiple columns and start entering your content. 

The Layout will show in the backend as well as in the Frontend

Grid UI + comes with it's own Grid Framework, so its Plug and Play from the start. Activate the Plugin and start creating Grid Layout for you Blog or Website. 

Do you already use a grid system like Bootstrap or Foundation?
- No Problem, Grid UI + will be allowingyou to customize the output to match your current Framework.
